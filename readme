🏆 Blind Auction Program

This project is a simple yet interactive Python-based blind auction system. It allows multiple participants to place hidden bids without revealing their amounts to others.

✨ Features

Accepts each bidder’s name and secret bid.

Stores all bids securely in a dictionary.

Clears the screen after each bid to maintain privacy.

Determines and announces the highest bidder as the winner.

⚙️ How It Works

Each player enters their name and bid.

Program asks if there are more bidders.

If yes, the screen clears and the next player enters.

If no, bidding closes.

The function find_highest_bidder() compares all bids.

The winner with the top bid is revealed.

🚀 Usage

Run the script, enter names and bids, and watch the program crown the top bidder. Perfect for practicing Python basics like dictionaries, loops, functions, and conditionals.
